# Gentle Introduction to Time Series
Climate change is a major environmental policy challenge. Understanding the shape of damage functions is critical to improving integrated assessment models (IAMs) used to estimate the social cost of carbon. Such estimates underpin policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and foster adaptive behaviors. Among the categories of damages, incremental cooling consumption in the power sector is often recognized as a top component. Given the rise of smart electricity meters and the wide adoption of electricity generation technology like solar panels, there is a wealth of electricity usage data available. This data represents a multivariate time series of power-related variables that in turn could be used to model and even forecast future electricity consumption.

Machine learning algorithms predict a single value and cannot be used directly for multi-step forecasting. Two strategies that can be used to make multi-step forecasts with machine learning algorithms are the recursive and the direct methods. In this module and quiz, weâ€™ll explore and build time series forecasting models for measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years.
