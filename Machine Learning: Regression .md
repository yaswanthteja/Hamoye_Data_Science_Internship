# Machine Learning: Regression - Predicting Energy Efficiency of Buildings

Regression, a statistical method used in finance, investing, and other disciplines, attempts to determine the strength and character of the relationship between one dependent variable and a series of other variables (known as independent variables). 

In this course, we will develop a multivariate multiple regression model to study the effect of eight input variables on two output variables, which are the heating load and the cooling load, of residential buildings.
